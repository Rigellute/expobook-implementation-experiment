This is a `react-native init` project that implements [`expobook`](https://github.com/teamplanes/expobook).

Goal is to create a storybook like experience but deploy the stories through expo.

This project is working but I've needed to install `expo` and expo's fork of `react-native` via - `yarn add https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-25.0.0.tar.gz`
